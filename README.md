# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results-of-Ecommerce-website
Udacity Advanced Data Analysis Project 

In this A/B test project, I am working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand wether they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
