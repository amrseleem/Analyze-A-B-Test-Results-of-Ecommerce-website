# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results-of-Ecommerce-website
Udacity Advanced Data Analysis Project 

In this A/B test project, I am working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand wether they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

In this conducted analysis, we wanted to look at a new-webage of an Ecommerce website. We wanted to see whether the treatment new page is significant received by the group users. In this analysis, part II and part III, the pvalues changed. For both cases, we were not able to reject the H0. There is no significance conversion for the the new page over old page. Analysis even showed that conversion rate for old page is slightly higher than new one. Comparing the the country and page also indicated no significant effects of conversion rate.

To sum it up, we could conclude that there is no significant change between conversions between the old and new pages. As a result H0 is True and we could not reject it. Also, we have tried to integrate other features like the country but still failed to reject H0. Indicators showed that old page perform well and we could drop the idea of having new page.
